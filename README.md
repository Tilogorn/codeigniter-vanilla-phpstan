This is repository is not intended to solve the existing conflicts between PHPStan and CodeIgniter but to be a playground for the issues created in both projects (see https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/2422 and https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5763)

Minimal working example as a use case of PHPStan with CodeIgniter V3

# Try it
- Clone this repo
- `$ cd application/`
- `$ php composer.phar phpstan`
